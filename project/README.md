* **Apache-maven V3.6.3** - Maven’s primary goal is to allow a developer to comprehend the complete state of a development effort in the shortest period of time. [apachemavenwebsite]  
* **Junit 4.12** - JUnit is a simple framework to write repeatable tests. It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks [junitwebsite]
* **Maven-surefire-plugin V2.19.1** - Surefire is a test framework project. This is the aggregator POM in Apache Maven Surefire project [mavensurefirewebsite]  
* **hamcrest** - Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects allowing ‘match’ rules to be defined declaratively [hamcrestwebsite]  
* **Spring-boot-starter-web** - Starter for building web, including RESTful, applications using Spring MVC. Uses Tomcat as the default embedded container [springbootstarterwebsite]  
* **Spring-boot-devtools** - pring Boot includes an additional set of tools that can make the application development experience a little more pleasant. The spring-boot-devtools module can be included in any project to provide additional development-time features [springbootdevtoolswebsite]  
* **Spring-boot-maven-plugin** - The Spring Boot Maven Plugin provides Spring Boot support in Maven, allowing you to package executable jar or war archives and run an application “in-place” [springbootmavenpluginwebsite]  
* **h2database** - H2 is an open-source lightweight Java database. It can be embedded in Java applications or run in the client-server mode. Mainly, H2 database can be configured to run as inmemory database, which means that data will not persist on the disk [h2databasewebsite]

* **ModelMapper V2.3.0** - Applications often consist of similar but different object models, where the data in two models may be similar but the structure and concerns of the models are different. Object mapping makes it easy to convert one model to another, allowing separate models to remain segregated [modelMapperwebsite]  
* **Jacoco-maven-plugin V0.7.9** - JaCoCo is a free code coverage library for Java, which has been created by the EclEmma team based on the lessons learned from using and integration existing libraries for many years. [jacocowebsite]
